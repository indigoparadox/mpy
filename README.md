This is a rough attempt to make a tiny environment or "fantasy console" on which to run limited python-esque programs in a VM with ready access to functions provided by maug/retroflat.

Subject to the same limitations as those projects (i.e. code must compile under ancient compilers like VC6).

It is very experimental, extremely unpolished and a lot of documentation is pending experimentation.
